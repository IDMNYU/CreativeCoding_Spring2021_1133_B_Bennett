# DM-UY 1133-B Creative Coding
##### Spring 2021 • Katherine Bennett • Tuesdays & Thursdays • 14:00-15:50pm 

## Sketch 1 Composition

#### Due February 14th 9AM EST  
#### Submission location TBA
			
_Come to class on Feb 11 with the sketch started and we will demo how to submit it together in class_

Create a sketch that uses a multitude of shapes, and shapes that are different. Use a variety of colors, both for the shapes and the background. Create a composition or collage with these shapes. I encourage you to be abstract, rather than literal. Yet, in the abstract, there can be some likeness to reality.

Check out the Slides on Slack (resources channel) for inspiration tips and possibilities

Recommendations: Do not do this in one sitting. Take breaks. Work on this in several sessions (and not the night before it's due).


#### Key aspects:

* On the https://processing.org/reference/, utilize the listings under: 2D Primitives, Curves, Attributes, Vertex, and Color
* Use a variety of different shapes, and different sizes
* Create your own shapes using beginShape(), vertex(), endShape()
* Use a variety of colors, different colors, different ranges of the same color
* Play with opacity
* When you are playing with opacity, also play with layering shapes on top of one another
* Understanding screen coordinates (where to place the shapes), creating shapes, using color, opacity are key here in building your compositions
* Your sketch size must be 500 x 500 pixels
* You may take a “meaty” crop of one of these images and re-create it

#### Tips:

* [Useful resources for curves (switch tab to playground)](http://yining1023.github.io/p5PlayGround/) 
* [Tutorial on Curves](https://processing.org/tutorials/curves/)
* Drawing out your composition on graph paper first, will help you understand coordinates. Make the top left corner (0, 0)
